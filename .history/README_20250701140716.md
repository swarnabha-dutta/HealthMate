| Path                                      | Description                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **app/(main)/pricing/page.jsx**            | Renders the pricing page: pricing table, FAQ, contact form, and navigation back to home.      |
| **app/(main)/contact/Contact.jsx**         | Displays a contact form for users to reach out to support.                                    |
| **components/pricing/**                    | Contains the pricing table UI logic and presentation.                                         |
| **components/ui/badge.jsx**                | Badge component for visual highlights (e.g., "Affordable Healthcare").                        |
| **components/ui/ContactForm.jsx**          | Handles user input and form submission for contacting support.                                |
| **prisma/schema.prisma**                   | Defines the database schema for users, consultations, and other entities.                     |
| **lib/db.js**                             | Sets up the Prisma client and connects to the Neon Postgres database.                         |
| **public/**                               | Stores static files like images and icons.                                                    |
| **README.md**                             | Project documentation, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines.                       |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Landing & Navigation**
   - Users land on the homepage and can navigate to the pricing page.
   - The pricing page (`app/(main)/pricing/page.jsx`) displays available consultation packages, a FAQ, and a contact form.

2. **Pricing Table**
   - The pricing table is rendered using components from `components/pricing/`.
   - Each package is clearly described with no hidden fees.

3. **Contact & Support**
   - Users can reach out via the contact form (`components/ui/ContactForm.jsx`), which is displayed on both the pricing and contact pages.
   - Form submissions are handled and can be connected to backend logic for notifications or support tickets.

4. **Database & Backend**
   - All user and consultation data is managed via Prisma ORM, with the schema defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
   - The database is hosted on Neon, a scalable serverless Postgres solution.
   - Backend logic (API routes, data fetching) is handled by Next.js and Node.js.

5. **Styling & UI**
   - Tailwind CSS is used for all styling, ensuring a responsive and modern look.
   - Lucide Icons provide clean, consistent iconography throughout the app.
